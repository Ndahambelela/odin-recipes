        <h2>Nutrition</h2>
        <p>
            Chicken is filled with high-quality proteins and doesn’t contain much fat — especially if you eat lean cuts. Beyond its rich protein content, chicken also contains.
        </p>
        <p>
            Chicken contains the amino acid tryptophan, which has been linked to higher levels of serotonin (the “feel good” hormone) in our brains. The tryptophan levels in chicken aren’t high enough to make you feel instantly euphoric, but studies show it could help to boost serotonin levels when paired with other factors.
