        <h2>Health Benefits of Tuna</h2>
        <p>
            Tuna is an excellent source of vitamin B12, an essential vitamin needed to make DNA. Vitamin B12 also helps you to form new red blood 
            cells and prevent the development of anemia.
        </p>
        <p>
            The high levels of omega-3 fatty acids in tuna fish may help to reduce the level of omega-6 fatty acids and LDL cholesterol that can accumulate inside the arteries of the heart. Studies have shown that eating more omega-3 is associated with reduced rates of 
            cardiovascular disease, including heart attacks.

            <li>Heat oil and butter in a large skillet over high heat until nearly smoking.</li>
            <li>Arrange tuna steaks in the skillet and cook until blackened on one side, about 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until desired doneness is reached, 3 to 4 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C) for medium-rare.</li>
