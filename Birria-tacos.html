        <h2>Birria Tacos Nutrition Facts</h2>
        <p>There’s no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the nutritional content of birria tacos can vary depending on the ingredients used.</p>
        <p>However, in general, birria tacos are a nutritious and filling meal option. They’re typically made with corn tortillas, which are a good source of complex carbohydrates, and filled with shredded beef, beans, and vegetables. This makes them a good source of protein, fiber, and vitamins and minerals. Birria tacos are also usually served with a broth made from the cooking juices of the beef, which adds additional flavor and nutrients.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tbsp sunflower oil</li>
            <li>1½ kg braising steak, cut into 15cm cubes</li>
            <li>4 guajillo chillies (available online), stem and seeds removed, or dried chillies</li>
            <li>1 large ancho chilli (available online), stem and seeds removed</li>
            <li>4 arbol chillies (available online; optional)</li>
            <li>2 medium tomatoes, cut in half</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, quartered</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>½ tsp dried oregano</li>
            <li>½ tsp ground cumin</li>
            <li>½ tsp ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>½ tsp ground ginger</li>
            <li>2 cloves</li>
            <li>3 black peppercorns</li>
            <li>1 tsp white wine vinegar</li>
            <li>2 bone marrow discs (ask your butcher)</li>
            <li>15g sea salt flakes</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oil in a large, heavy- based, ovenproof saucepan over a medium-high heat and brown the braising steak all over, about 8-10 mins. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat a frying pan over a medium heat and toast the guajillo and ancho chillies for 2 mins, making sure not to burn them. If you want the birria to be spicy, add the arbol chillies. Transfer to a lidded saucepan with the tomatoes and onion. Peel the garlic and add this, too. Add 500ml water, cover, bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for 5 mins. Turn the heat off and set aside to cool.</li>
            <li>Transfer the tomatoes, onion and chillies to a blender, reserving the cooking liquor. Add the spices, vinegar and 2 tbsp of the cooking liquor to the blender, then blend until smooth. Heat the oven to 140C/120C fan/gas 1.</li>
            <li>Put the meat back over a medium heat, then add the bone marrow, salt and bay leaves. Pass the blended chilli sauce through a sieve into the pan to ensure it’s silky smooth. Pour in 1 litre water and the remaining cooking liquor. Cover and transfer to the oven for 3 hrs until the meat is tender and falling apart. After 1 hr 30 mins, season to taste.</li>
            <li>Remove the meat from the broth using a slotted spoon, transfer to a board and shred using two forks. The broth should have thickened.</li>
            <li>To serve, put shredded beef in a bowl, pour over the broth, then garnish with the coriander, onion and spicy salsa. Serve with limes on the side for squeezing over. Or, heat a corn tortilla, add some shredded birria beef and garnish with the coriander, onion and a squeeze of lime, and serve the broth on the side in a small cup. To make a quesabirria, heat a corn tortilla, add some grated mozzarella cheese and some of the beef. Once the cheese has melted, pour 1 tbsp of the broth under and over the tortilla, and serve more broth on the side.</li>
        </ol>
